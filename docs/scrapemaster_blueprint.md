## 4. Feature Specifications

### 4.1 Core Features

#### 4.1.1 Feature: Web Scraping Engine
**Description**: A comprehensive web scraping engine capable of extracting data from static and dynamic websites using configurable selectors, with support for JavaScript rendering, custom headers, and rate limiting.

**User Stories**
- **US-001**: As a data analyst, I want to configure CSS selectors to extract specific data elements so that I can collect structured information from web pages
- **US-002**: As a researcher, I want to scrape JavaScript-rendered content so that I can access data from modern single-page applications
- **US-003**: As a user, I want to set custom headers and user agents so that I can avoid being blocked by anti-bot measures

**Acceptance Criteria**
☐ Given a valid URL and CSS selector, when the scraper runs, then it should extract all matching elements with 95% accuracy
☐ Given a JavaScript-heavy website, when using browser mode, then the scraper should wait for content to load and extract dynamic data
☐ Given rate limiting configuration, when scraping multiple pages, then the system should respect delays and avoid overwhelming target servers
