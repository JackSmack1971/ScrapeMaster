# Security Best Practices

ScrapeMaster Pro follows strict security standards to protect user data and ensure reliable scraping.

## Environment Variables
- **Never** hardcode API keys or credentials.
- Use environment variables for all secrets and configuration values.

## Input Validation
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs and scraped data.
- Leverage `express-validator` or similar libraries to enforce schemas.

## Retries and Timeouts
- Configure appropriate timeouts for network requests.
- Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for transient failures.

## Custom Exception Handling
- Wrap asynchronous operations in `try/catch` blocks.
- Throw custom error classes so the API returns consistent responses without revealing sensitive details.

Following these guidelines helps reduce security risks and improves the reliability of ScrapeMaster Pro.
